## **🔧 Technical Implementation**

### **State Management**
```typescript
// Enhanced filtering state
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');
const [contentTypeFilter, setContentTypeFilter] = useState<'all' | 'PRE_READ' | 'ASSIGNMENT' | 'LECTURE_NOTE'>('all');
```

### **Filtering Logic**
```typescript
const getFilteredTasks = () => {
  return tasks.filter((assignment) => {
    // Apply status filter
    let statusMatch = true;
    switch (filter) {
      case 'assigned': statusMatch = !assignment.content; break;
      case 'review': statusMatch = assignment.content?.status === 'REVIEW'; break;
      case 'rejected': statusMatch = assignment.content?.status === 'REJECTED'; break;
      case 'approved': statusMatch = assignment.content?.status === 'APPROVED'; break;
      case 'all': default: statusMatch = true;
    }

    // Apply search filter
    const searchMatch = searchQuery === '' || 
      assignment.topic.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
      assignment.content?.title?.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
      assignment.assignedTo.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
      assignment.assignedTo.email.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase());

    // Apply content type filter
    const contentTypeMatch = contentTypeFilter === 'all' || 
      assignment.contentType === contentTypeFilter;

    return statusMatch && searchMatch && contentTypeMatch;
  });
};
```

### **UI Components**
- **Search Input**: With search icon and placeholder text
- **Content Type Dropdown**: Styled select with all options
- **Status Tabs**: Enhanced with accurate counts
- **Clear Filters**: Conditional button with icon
